# What is EmojiFinder?
EmojiFInder is a site that helps you find emoji by keywords.

# Technology
The site is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java. Also from libraries, frameworks and other I used Spring, Bootstrap, jQuery, Google Fonts.

# How does it work?
The site sends an API request to EmojisWorld (https://github.com/abourtnik/emojis-world). I would like to point out that the API has a **limit** on the number of requests, namely **500 per IP per day**.
